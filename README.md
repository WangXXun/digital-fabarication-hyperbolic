# Robotic Prefabricated Plywood System

Time: 2018

Where: Southeast University

Tutor: Li Biao, Hua Hao

Collaborator: Hao Han, Jacky Chen

The Void pavilion was constructed in the courtyard of the Architectural School. The three-student team designed, fabricated and assembled the timber structure within eight weeks in collaboration with Nanjing YAOYANG Technology.

The pavilion is the first implementation of a robotic prefabricated plywood system (RPPS). Various form-finding approaches of funicular structures were experimented via programming in Processing. Eventually a generative model was developed to create the configurable shape of a new type of fibreboard pavilions. A robotic cut/mill system was employed as it is more robust than 3-axis CNC milling machine.  Our team used Processing to produce the KRL codes for toolpath planning of the KUKA robot. The off-line programming via Processing also integrated the bin packing algorithm to pack the hundreds of pieces into 30 plywood sheets (1.2Ã—2.4m). The geometric details of the wooden joints were directly encoded in the robotic toolpath.  Without any nails or fasteners, a typical connection can be made exclusively by the plywood components. The beams are 30mm think with two layers of 15mm plywood. The manual assembly took two days.
